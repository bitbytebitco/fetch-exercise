Fetch Android Exercise
==================================

```fetch-exercise``` is a native Android app, written using Kotlin, that displays a scrollable list of items, sorted first by ```listId``` and then by ```name``` attribute. 
The [data](https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/hiring.json) used to generate the list of items is loaded from a GET request to a web server acting as a REST web service.
Any items where ```name``` is blank or null are omitted from the displayed list.
